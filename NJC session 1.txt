Explain SDLC at a high level

It is a process that starts when a customer has a business idea for an application, once a contract has been signed with a company to build the idea. To make this happen the following list outlines the different phases in order, that any such project would go through from start to finish.

Planning
Where the customer or a representative meets together with a product owner, to define the requirements of the application at a high level.

Requirement Analysis
The product owner will meet up with the team to define each requirement more in depth to give more planning details.

Design
The broken down requirements are used to then plan the product, this may include issues such as colour schemes, UI layout, frameworks, what programming languages to use and database relationships.
	
Implementation/coding
Where the fun starts, the operations team will set up the physical hardware for the servers, the developers will write the code, the designers will continue planning the UI. Testers will begin to analyse the requirements to plan test cases.

Testing
One of the most important phases, to validate all requirements have been met, to make sure the functionality is working as expected, to find as many bugs as they possibly can.

Deployment
Getting ready for production then to go live to real users.


Maintenance
Monitor the load, maintain the environment and fix further bugs found. During the maintenance phase, new requirements will be discovered and the process can start again to upgrade or install new features into the existing application.



2) What is waterfall and why it is still relevant

Waterfall is a development methodology, which consists of a linear sequential life cycle. Following this approach any given task can only be started once the task before it has been completed. 

It is criticised in modern development because over the lifetime of a project using waterfall, the level of visibility diminishes from the point of planning until deployment, along the way opportunities for adaptability are non existent due to cost, effort and time. The business value a customer receives is not tangible until the absolute end which can be substantial periods of time, by which time the fast paced market has moved on and now the product and customer has suffered as a consequence.
However, it is still relevant because for some applications, the developers and clients can still start out with an extremely clear idea of what they want to achieve with the application or for some projects that are small with low risk of change. In such situations the waterfall approach presents a cheaper alternative requiring less resources and effort along with being time tested and reliable.
