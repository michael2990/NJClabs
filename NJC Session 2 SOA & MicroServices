SOA & MicroServices
 
What are the main benefits of SOA?

Self contained services
Loosely coupled 
Reusabiltiy, dont have to keep building the same service in different enviroments  
Isolation Testing/Debugging
Vendor nuetral communications framework


How can you achieve loose coupling in SOA ?

Service contract and Metadata
Distributed control
Using mediators either broker or ESB

Are web services and SOA the same?

SOA and web services are not the same thing. SOA is an architecturethat allows developers to combine
multiple application services into a larger, composite service. SOA can be implemented using SOAP-based 
web services or REST APIs, or sometimes a combination. It's important to understand that in SOA, 
a service is any remotely available resource that can respond to requests. Where as a web service is implemented 
using specific protocols.


What is a reusable service?

For example a business can provide some services to a customer like checking credit, checking delivery status and stock. 
These functionalities are common for businesses, and so its possible to reuse any of these servicesinstead of recreating them
when building different applications for different businesses.

and supporting communication protocol. It is the central part to an SOA and is the carrier for all consumer and service 
interactions.
